                Objective:
              
              The objective of this project is to develop a sentiment analysis system that can accurately classify customer reviews as positive, negative, or neutral, and provide insights into customer sentiments towards different brands and products on Amazon.<br>
              
              Methodology:
              
              Data Collection: Collect a large dataset of Amazon customer reviews for various brands and products.
              Pre-processing: Pre-process the collected data by tokenizing the text, removing stop words, and converting all text to lowercase.
              Sentiment Analysis: Use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to analyze the pre-processed data and classify the reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.<br>
              Entity Extraction: Extract specific entities such as product names, brands, and features from the reviews.<br>
              Sentiment Scoring: Assign a sentiment score to each review based on the sentiment analysis results.<br>

              Tools and Technologies:
              
              Amazon Comprehend: A natural language processing (NLP) service that can be used for sentiment analysis, entity extraction, and topic modeling.
              Python: A programming language that can be used for data pre-processing, sentiment analysis, and entity extraction.
              Machine Learning Algorithms: Such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest can be used for sentiment analysis.</p></p>
